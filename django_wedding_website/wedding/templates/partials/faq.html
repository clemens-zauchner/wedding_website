            <h3>How to get to Innsbruck</h3>
            <p>
                A flight to <strong>Innsbruck</strong> directly is very beautiful as you will see a lot of mountains but
                it can be
                quite expensive.
                If you fly in to Innsbruck directly, there is a public bus (F) to connect you to the city centre.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also the option to fly to <strong>Munich</strong> and to take the
                <a href="https://tickets.oebb.at/en/ticket">train</a> or
                depending on when you will arrive, an airport taxi. We can recommend
                <a href="https://www.tirol-taxi.at/">fourseasons</a>. Be careful not to book a flight to Munich
                West/Memmingen. There are no trains there.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a direct OEBB Railjet train to Innsbruck from <strong>Vienna</strong> Airport,
                but the train journey is around 4.5 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                From <strong>Zurich</strong> Airport you can take a short train ride to Zurich train station
                to get on the OEBB Railjet to Innsbruck. The journey is about 4 hours.

            <h3>Getting around in Innsbruck</h3>
            <h4>Public transport</h4>
            <p>
                It is very easy to get around Innsbruck. In most cases you don't need public transport,
                as everything is within a 10-15 minute walking distance. However, there are trams and busses
                available. There are daily and weekly tickets available. An overview of tickets can be found
                at <a href="https://tickets.vvt.at/en/ticket/offer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IVB</a>
                for Innsbruck and at
                <a href="https://tickets.vvt.at/en/ticket?tabIndex=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VVT</a>
                for all of Tyrol.

            </p>
            <h4>Taxi</h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately there is no Uber in Innsbruck. You can call a taxi by dialling
                <a href="tel:+435125311">+43 512 5311</a>
                or
